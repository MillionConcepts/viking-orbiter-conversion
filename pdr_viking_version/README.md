# pdr: Viking Orbiter Imaging version

This is a 'frozen' fork of `pdr`. It is a slightly modified version of the 
0.7.2 release with some added special-case handling for the Viking Orbiter 
EDRs. This fork is intended only for replicating/tracing the results of the
conversion process. For any other purpose, please use the most recent 
version of `pdr`, which can be found on conda-forge, PyPi, or
[its GitHub repo](https://github.com/MillionConcepts/pdr).
