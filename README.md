# viking orbiter imaging data conversion

This repository contains documentation for modernized versions of the Viking Orbiter 1 and 2
(VO-1 and VO-2) imaging data sets. It will soon also contain the software we used to produce
these data products.

The [primary bundle documentation](document/primary_bundle_documentation.md) provides the
best introduction to the contents of this repository.
